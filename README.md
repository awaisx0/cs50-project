# CS50 Final Project - Personal Progress Tracker 

#### Video demo:

### Description 
This is my cs50 final project. Cs50 has been an amazing journey, and the best course on intro to cs I ever took. it really taught me a lot.
For this final project, I went on to create a personal progress tracker. It's a simple tool I built for myself in which i can add progress of each day. 

### How does it work?
It works pretty simply:
- Click on any date you want at Calendar page
- A modal will appear in which there are fields of time, category, text of what work did and a textarea for day's reflection/thoughts. You can add as many fields as you want
- After filling out your work of day, just click "Save" and your day's progress is saved.
- Whenever you want to see what work you did on a particular date, just click on that date from calendar and a modal will open showing you all work of that day. 
- You can simply edit and update your work whenever you want
- You can navigate to dashboard page and there you can see your work on month in a table. 


### Tech I used:
- React for frontend 
- Python backend with flask
- SQLite3 for database 
- React-Router for implementing basic navigation 
- `react-calendar` library was used to render calendar
